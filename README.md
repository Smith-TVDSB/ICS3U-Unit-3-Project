# ICS3U-Unit-3-Project

For data we can structure it a number of ways. For this project you may use either arrays, vectors, data structures or a combination of them. The purpose of this program is to take in a list of names associated with a list of scores to make calculations and searchable data. The program must meet the following requirements:
1.	Ask the user of the number of players (max of 8)
2.	Allow the user to enter the name AND score of each player
a.	Names must be limited to 40 characters in length.
b.	Scores must be positive only.
3.	Calculate the total of all player scores using a function
4.	Have a menu system that lets the user select:
a.	Display scores, with the total
b.	Search for name
c.	Reset an entry (by finding one person’s name) 
i.	Search for the name, then set the name to “empty” and the score to 0
d.	Update empty entry
Watch for:
1.	Do you have redundant code, conditions, or variables? 
2.	Perhaps a data type or structure that’s bigger than it needs to be.
3.	Are you commenting and sectioning your code?
4.	Could you reuse code in a function?
5.	Are you handling errors?
6.	Are you using a naming convention? camelCase or snake_case? Stay consistent with one
Challenges:
Each number and letter are worth one challenge, the letters build off the number they are under.
1.	Calculate the following (each sub section counts as 1 challenge, 5 total):
a.	Highest score
i.	Second and third highest scores
b.	Lowest score
c.	Average Score
d.	Most common score (mode)
2.	Allow the user to add a player if they haven’t already hit the max number of players. (1 challenge)
3.	Allow the user to swap two players scores by entering their names one at a time. (1 challenge)
4.	The maximum score is 65 535, select the smallest data size possible to fit this number. (1 challenge)
